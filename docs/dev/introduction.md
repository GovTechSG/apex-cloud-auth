# Introduction to JWT

JWT stands for JSON Web Token and is defined in [RFC7519](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7519).

Generally it consists of 3 sections: ***Header, Payload*** and ***Signature***, delimited by dot '***.***'.

```
Example of JWT:

eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLA0KICJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJqb2UiLA0KICJleHAiOjEzMDA4MTkzODAsDQogImh0dHA6Ly9leGFt

```


The ***Header*** and ***Payload*** are base64-encoded and consists of various claims which define the attribute of the JWT as well as the API request.

The ***Signature*** is a generated hash of the header and payload using a private key which the API requester owns.

```
Example of decoded JWT header and payload in the above example:

{"typ":"JWT",
 "alg":"HS256"}

{"iss":"joe",
 "exp":1300819380,
 "http://example.com/is_root":true}
```

An explanation of typical JWT claims used are as follows:

|S/No|JWT Claim|Comments|
|---|---|---|
|1  |alg|Signing algorithm of the JWT signature.|
|2  |typ|Type of JWT.|
|3  |kid|This is the key ID of the public key used by the API endpoint to validate the signature.|
|4  |iat|This is the epoch time in seconds issued at the of API call. This is usually generated by the signing library.|
|5  |exp|This is the epoch time in seconds of the expiry time of this JWT.|
|6  |jti|This is a random text string (nonce) for this JWT.|
|7  |iss|This identifies the API requesting party.|
|8  |aud|This identifies the API receipent.|
|9  |sub|This identifies the principal that is the subject of the JWT.|
